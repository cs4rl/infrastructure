The aim of the publication is to inspire researcher and the library community.","Welcome to Library Infrastructures and Citizen Science the second section of the guide series Citizen Science for Research Libraries. The aim of the publication is to inspire researcher and the library community to take a creative approach and take a second look at the infrastructures around them and how they can be applied to citizen science projects. Open science has already expanded the array of tools and practices used by research infrastructure. The challenge is how to take these one step further for citizen science, for example - expanding roles for acknowledgement, in collecting data, or providing pathways for the use of open access by the public.

The section editor of Research Infrastructures and Citizen Science, Kirsty Wallis of UCL Library, has brought together voices from across the research infrastructure community to show off existing facilities who are looking to support citizen science, combined with a range of case studies that have implemented citizen science research projects.

The guide series is brought to you by the LIBER Citizen Science Working Group and is part of the groups work to help share knowledge and facilitate academic libraries in their support of scholars managing citizen science research projects. As the maintainer of research infrastructures, like - repositories, persistent identifiers, collections, etc - libraries also help develop and disseminate methods and know-how. To this end the guide is a complement to the other stands of the working groups activities in advocacy, knowledge sharing, and partnerships.

The guide is designed to be a practical toolbox to help run a citizen science project. It has been put together from contributions by members of the research library community. The guide is part of a themed series of four sections - skills, infrastructures, good (open) practice, and programme development - based on the LIBER Open Science Roadmap .","","","About the Book 6
